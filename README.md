## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

### 🔧 Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.x installed with the following libraries:

```bash
pip install pillow
```


Tkinter is included with standard Python distributions. If not, install via:

    On Ubuntu: sudo apt-get install python3-tk

    On Fedora: sudo dnf install python3-tkinter


##🔐 SSL Certificate

You’ll need a certificate file (e.g., certificate.pem) generated by the server.

Ensure CERTIFICATE_PATH in the code matches your certificate file location:
```bash

CERTIFICATE_PATH = "certificate.pem"
```

##🚀 Running the App

    Clone or download this repo.

    Update the following constants in the script:

HOST = "your.server.ip.address"
PORT = 5555  # Or whatever the server uses

    Launch the app:
```bash
python whiteboard_client.py
```
